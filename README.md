# Software Developer Career Day Presentation
This is a presentation I did for 8th graders in a computer science class at a
Las Vegas public middle school in 2013.  I'm sharing it here as an example of 
how easy it is to talk to kids about programming.  I was able to catch up with 
one of the students as he graduated from High School and he still remembered this
presentation 5 years late.

Someone who is introduced to computer science and programming in primary school
is more likely to take a CS course in secondary school.  Someone who takes a 
CS course in high school is more likely to major in CS in college.  Getting a CS
degree is a high probability route for having a career as a software developer.

It is my thesis that by evangelizing CS courses to public school students that
students that might have not known how to approach this field will then 
be able to evaluate the path of being a software developer as a career.
